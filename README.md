## 📖 MY ORIGIN STORY  
I started in commerce until spreadsheets became too small for my ambitions. Heartbreak turned into the fuel for coding, and I found my calling in AI. I learned machine learning **with the help of machine learning**—my first mentor was an algorithm. Today, every line of code is a dialogue between human intuition and artificial brilliance.

## 🧠 MY PHILOSOPHY  
- **AI with Soul:** Machines should understand, not just compute.  
- **Brutal Simplification:** The best architectures work invisibly.  
- **First-Principles Coding:** I build solutions from the ground up.  
- **Zero Legacy Thinking:** Design for tomorrow, not yesterday.  
- **Spiritual Hustle:** Focus is the secret ingredient in innovation.
