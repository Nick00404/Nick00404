## 📖 MY ORIGIN STORY  
I started in commerce until spreadsheets became too small for my ambitions. Heartbreak turned into the fuel for coding, and I found my calling in AI. I learned machine learning **with the help of machine learning**—my first mentor was an algorithm. Today, every line of code is a dialogue between human intuition and artificial brilliance.

## 🧠 MY PHILOSOPHY  
- **AI with Soul:** Machines should understand, not just compute.  
- **Brutal Simplification:** The best architectures work invisibly.  
- **First-Principles Coding:** I build solutions from the ground up.  
- **Zero Legacy Thinking:** Design for tomorrow, not yesterday.  
- **Spiritual Hustle:** Focus is the secret ingredient in innovation.

## 🎨 CUSTOM THEME: CYBERPUNK / DARK MODE VIBES  
I believe in a style that’s as bold as the code inside. Here are some tips to create a custom GitHub profile theme:

- **Dark/Cyberpunk Aesthetics:**  
  Use a dark banner image, neon accents, and cyberpunk fonts.  
  [Explore Cyberpunk UI Kits](https://dribbble.com/tags/cyberpunk_ui) for inspiration.

- **Custom CSS with GitHub Profile Readme:**  
  While GitHub itself limits custom CSS, you can showcase your style in your assets (banners, logos, etc.).  
  Consider linking to a live demo or a website that reflects your theme.

- **Tools & Resources:**  
  - [Shields.io](https://shields.io) for custom badges.  
  - [GitHub Readme Stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) for dynamic cards.  
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for hosting a personal site with full theme control.

## 💬 LET’S CONNECT  
- **LinkedIn:** [Your LinkedIn URL](#)  
- **Twitter:** [Your Twitter Handle](#)  
- **DMs Open:** Always up for collabs that blur the lines between man and machine.
