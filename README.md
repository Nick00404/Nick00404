# 👋 Yo, I'm Nick

Just one month into the world of **AI & Machine Learning** and already knee-deep in projects I used to think were rocket science. I'm not claiming to be an expert—yet—but I’m obsessed with figuring things out, one line of code at a time.

## 🧠 Currently Learning

- How machines *actually* learn (turns out, it's not magic)
- Building ML pipelines from scratch (and breaking them for fun)
- Making chatbots that don’t sound like robots
- The dark arts of Docker, FastAPI, and Terraform

# 🚀 Under The Hood University (UTHU)

> “I am building the repo every engineer wishes they had when they started learning AI + MLOps + Fullstack.”

## 🛠 Projects I’m Proud Of (Even If They're Messy)

- [**ml_pipeline_automation**](https://github.com/Nick00404/ml_pipeline_automation)  
  My personal lab for experimenting with how ML models move from notebook to real-world.

- [**chatbot_production**](https://github.com/Nick00404/chatbot_production)  
  Built a chatbot. Not sentient yet, but it’s polite.

## 🔧 Toolbox (So Far)

**Languages:** Python, Bash  
**ML Stuff:** scikit-learn, pandas, XGBoost  
**DevOps-y Things:** Docker, FastAPI, GitHub Actions  
**On My Radar:** PyTorch, MLflow, DVC, Prefect

## 📅 Why I'm Doing This

I’m not here to memorize algorithms—I’m here to **build stuff** that works, scales, and teaches me something in the process. Eventually, I want to:

- Work on real-world AI problems
- Build scalable ML tools/products
- Become the engineer past-me was googling for answers from
